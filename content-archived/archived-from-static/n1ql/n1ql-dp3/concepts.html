<h1 class="title topictitle1">Concepts</h1>


<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">N1QL is a query language for Couchbase Server - a document database. N1QL queries
 documents that store information about a data items and about relationships between documents. </p>


 <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Couchbase Server</h2>
  

 <p class="p">Document-oriented databases, such as Couchbase Server, use documents to store information as
        well as relationships among documents. This model is flexible enough so that 
        application objects can be changed without having to migrate the database schema or plan for significant
        application downtime. Even the same type of object in an application can have a different
        data structures. For instance, a user name can initially be represented as a single document
        field. Later, a user document can be structured so that the first name and last name are
        separate fields in the document. These changes can be done without any application
        downtime and without having to update all user documents in the system. </p>

   <p class="p">The other advantage
        to the flexible, document-based data model is that it is well suited to representing real-world items.
        Documents support nested structures, as well as fields representing object
        properties. Both of these attributes enable realistically represented objects in an application.
        To find information in a document-oriented database, a language is needed that
        provides the correct logic for navigating documents and document structures 
        including navigation within a single document and searches across multiple documents.
        </p>

 </div>


 <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Data Modeling</h2>
  
  <p class="p">Couchbase Server is a document database: data is stored in the form of documents rather than rows or columns. 
    Couchbase has a much more flexible data format; documents generally contain all
        the information about a data entity, including compound data. In the case of traditional,
        relational databases, data may need to be spread from a single object across multiple
        tables, a process known as normalization. </p>

        
       <p class="p">Consider an application for contacts and their families. The contact information 
         could be stored in a table row via a relational database or as  
        in an individual document per contact via a document-based model. In traditional
     relational databases, a table is used to represent a real-world object and its
     respective attributes. For instance, in a contacts database, a table would have
     contacts, such as id, first name, last name, and so on. In the following diagram, the
     relational model conforms to a rigid schema with a specified number of fields which
     represent a specific purpose in an application and a fixed datatype for each code
     column. Instead of a table, an object is represented as one or more documents.</p>

   
        <div class="fig fignone"><img class="image" src="images/rel_vs_doc_model.png" width="700"/><p class="figcap">Contact documents vs table</p>
        </div>

  
  <p class="p">A document in a document-oriented database is a JSON object consisting of a number of fields
   that are defined. An object can be one or more documents and object attributes can be fields in the document. 
   In comparison, a relational database
   has columns in a table which hold a type of attribute, such as name or zip code. There is no
   schema in document-oriented databases; every JSON document can have its own individual set of
   keys, although one or more informal schemas could be adopted for data. Unlike the
   relational mode, attributes within a document do not have to have a predefined type.</p>

  
  <p class="p"> For instance, a zip code can be an integer or a string using the document
        model. Even documents belonging to the same class of application objects, such as a customer
        document can have different attributes than other customer documents. For example, 
        some customers can have an extra field for shipping insurance, while other customer
        documents do not have that field at all. </p>

 </div>


 <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Nested Structures and Paths</h2>
  
  <p class="p">In traditional relational databases, each record is represented by a table row and attributes
   for a record are represented by each column in a table. In a document-database, a record is
   represented by one or more documents. Attributes for a business object are represented by fields
   in the document. For example, imagine a simple document representing a customer: </p>

  
  <pre class="pre codeblock">
 {
 "id": "7983345",
 "name": "Liam Kilpatrick",
 "type": "retail"
 ....
 }
 
 A document field can contain nested data structures such as arrays and objects; within an array or object, you can further nest data. For example, consider a more complex document representing a customer order:
 
 {
 "type": "customer-order",
 "grand_total": 1000,
 "billTo": {
 "street": "123 foo",
 "state": "CA",
 },
 "shipTo": {
 "street": "123 foo",
 "state": "CA"
 },
 items: [
 { "productId": "coffee", "qty": 1 },
 { "productId": "tea", "qty": 1 }
 ]
 }
 </pre>

  <p class="p">This makes N1QL a unique querying language compared to SQL. In order to navigate nested data in
    document arrays and objects, N1QL supports the concept of paths. A path uses a dot notation
    syntax and provides the logical location of an attribute within a document. For example, to get
    the street from a customer order, the path, <samp class="ph codeph">orders.billTo.street</samp> is used. This path refers to the
    value for 'street' in the 'billTo' object. A path is used with a arrays or nested objects 
    to get to attributes within the data structure. Array syntax in the path
    can also be used to get to information. For example,</p>

  <pre class="pre codeblock">orders.items[0].productId</pre>

  <p class="p">This path evaluates to the value, coffee, since coffe is the productID for the first array
   element under the order item, items. Paths provide a mothod for finding data in document structures without having
   to retrieve the entire document or handle it within an application. Any document data can be
   requested and returned to an application. When only relevant information is returned to an application,
   querying bandwidth is reduced.</p>

 </div>


 <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Queries and Result Sets</h2>
  
  <p class="p">Queries consist of a single command and zero or more optional clauses, which can filter, run
    operations, or perform functions on data. The query command along with any clauses are known as
    a query string. When you perform a query, Couchbase Server takes the query string and produces a
    result set, which is a JSON array containing any result values.</p>
 
  
   <p class="p">A single Couchbase server instance can have one or more buckets and an entire Couchbase cluster has 
     more than one bucket. N1QL functionality not only allow queries against single bucket 
     but also across multiple buckets. In addition, JOINs can be performed across multiple data buckets. 
   </p>

  
  <p class="p">Besides a command, each query can have multiple optional
    parts, including clauses, expressions and functions.</p>

  
   <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">Expressions are the parts of a query that compare values against one another or perform
     arithmetic calculations.</li>

    <li class="li">Clauses are typically used for the limiting the scope of a query.</li>

   </ul>

<p class="p">When a query is performed, a sequence of steps are
   executed. Each step corresponds to the different clauses and expressions in a query. The
   expressions evaluated first produce an intermediate result set, which is also known as
   output objects. The output objects from a step then become the input for the next step and
   produce the next result set. 
   After all expressions have been evaluated in a query, the final result set is returned. </p>
