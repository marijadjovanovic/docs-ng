	<title>Stream-based views</title>
	<abstract>
		<shortdesc>Stream-based views reduce latency for view updates, providing faster view
			consistency and fresher data.</shortdesc> This feature uses the new streaming protocol,
		Database Change Protocol (DCP). </abstract>


	<conbody>

		<p>With DCP, data does not need to be persisted to disk before you can retrieve it with a view
			query. DCP offers the following benefits for views: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Views are updated with key-value data sooner.</li>
			<li>Latency for view updates is reduced.</li>
			<li>Views are more closely synchronized with the data.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>When you submit a view query, you can include a parameter that specifies your data
			freshness requirements. The name of the parameter is <codeph>stale</codeph> and it takes
			the following values:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><codeph>ok</codeph>—The server returns the current entries from the index file.</li>
			<li><codeph>update_after</codeph>—The server returns the current entries from the index,
				and then initiates an index update.</li>
			<li><codeph>false</codeph>—The server waits for the indexer to finish the changes that
				correspond to the current key-value document set and then returns the latest entries
				from the view index.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Every 5 seconds the automatic update process checks whether 5000 changes have occurred. If a
			minimum of 5000 changes occurred, an index update is triggered. Otherwise, no update is
			triggered. When triggered, the indexer requests from DCP all changes since it was last run.
			The default number of changes to check for is 5000, but that number can be configured by
			setting the <codeph>updateMinChanges</codeph> option. The update interval can also be
			configured by setting the <codeph>updateInterval</codeph> option. </p>

		<p>When an application sends a query that has the <codeph>stale</codeph> parameter set to
			false, the application receives all recent changes to the documents, including changes that
			haven't yet been persisted to disk.</p>

		<note othertype="Best practice" type="other">For better scalability and throughput, we recommend
			setting the value of the <codeph>stale</codeph> parameter to <codeph>ok</codeph>. With the
			stream-based views feature, data returned when <codeph>stale</codeph> is set to
				<codeph>ok</codeph> is closer to the key-value data, even though it might not include
			all of it.</note>
